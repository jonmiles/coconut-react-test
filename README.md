# React Test

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First ensure required dependencies are install

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Environmenet Variables

In order for the API requests to work successful, you must ensure the correct environment variable is define for CN_API_KEY. For local development, this is defined in the dot env file; .env.local.

It will be included in this distributed zip file, but is normally excluded from the git repo.
